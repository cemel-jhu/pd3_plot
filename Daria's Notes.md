    - A crystal is a solid made of atoms, ions, or molecules in a repetitive pattern
    - Each crystal structure in a specific crystal system is defined by a unit cell
    - Unit cell = the smallest repeatable subsection of the crystal

    - Types of cubic crystals: Simple, Face-centered, and Body-centered
        - face- centered: the atoms are at each of the cornoers and the centers of all the cube faces
        - Simple:
        - Body-Centered:

    - Slip = plastic deformation produced by dislocation motion
    - Slip plane = the horizontal plane separating the stationary lower block of atoms from the displaced top block.
    - ffc = face centered cubic structure
    - slip planes of ffc = __________________

    - A dislocation is a defect in the lattice (a missing atom)
    - dislocation density = the total dislocation length per unit volume
    - A sessile dislocation = when the the burgers vector? isn't contained in one of the planes and it can't glide and mvove under applied stress. It CAN move by climb (climb = ).
    - A glissile dislocation = when the extended dislocation (?) has shockley partials and astacking fault(??) and can glide in its own glide plane (??).
        - look up things with question marks in more detail
    - The burgers vector measures the difference between the distorted lattice at the dislocation and the perfect lattice. It also is the direction and magnitude of the atomic displacement that happens when a dislocation happens.
        - the space between the gap in the loop around the atoms.
    - Types of dislocations:
        - screw dislocation
            - the dislocation moves perpendicular to the direction of stress
            - The lattice plane shifts like a spiral staircase 
        - edge dislocation
            - The dislocation moves parallel to the direction of stress
    - Discrete dislocation dynamics = ?
