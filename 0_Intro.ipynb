    "In discrete dislocation dynamics, we typically think of these of these lattice mismatches (or dislocations) [as similar to a graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHqQDA3be-k). This is a pretty fun area of math, I'm sad all the examples I found online were pretty boring. Notably, we DO care where the vertices (we call them nodes) are, and DO care about additional physical information assosiated with the edges (or segments as we refer to them). However, treating DDD as a graph problem makes it easier for use when programming."
